### Context:
Video Conferencer was created as part of my A-Level Computer Science coursework project. The report is written in
Latex and is available in the Report folder. It is intended to be a simplified version of Zoom so that anyone and
everyone can start video conferencing easily.

It is written using React and Go and is deployed using Vercel.
