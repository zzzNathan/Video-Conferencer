1 & System should be intuitive and easy to grasp & {
This web page is indeed designed in an intuitive and user
friendly manner, this is demonstrated through
it's clear structure and visual hierarchy.
Users are immediately drawn to the prominent
gradient-styled heading "Video conferencing" which effectively
communicates the platform's core purpose. They then have option
to click one of the call to action buttons to either sign up or
login immediately after viewing the heading, if they so choose.
Finally the user is provided with a variety of common actions
in the top navigation bar, so they can quickly and efficiently
access the information they require.
