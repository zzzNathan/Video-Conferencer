From our post-developement testing we have \textbf{clearly} provided annotated evidence of post development testing
for function and robustness. \\

\section{Evaluating success criteria}

\newcommand{\evalone}{%
This web page is indeed designed in an intuitive and user
friendly manner, this is demonstrated through
it's clear structure and visual hierarchy.
Users are immediately drawn to the prominent
gradient-styled heading "Video conferencing" which effectively
communicates the platform's core purpose. They then have option
to click one of the call to action buttons to either sign up or
login immediately after viewing the heading, if they so choose.
Finally the user is provided with a variety of common actions
in the top navigation bar, so they can quickly and efficiently
access the information they require.
\textit{Reference:} {\sffamily Test (16)} \url{https://youtu.be/Ii8QkbziWo4}
}

\newcommand{\evaltwo}{%
For our log in
system we make use of Clerk, a thoroughly tested and widely used
API for handling the user log in feature. Since Clerk is an
industry standard API we assume that their infastructure is indeed
secure and completely compliant with GDPR regulations.
\textit{Reference:} Refer to
\url{https://clerk.com/docs/security/overview} for details. \\ \vspace{0.1cm}

On the other hand for our events system though no errors arised during
iterative testing, we have not created a rigorous security test for
this part of the back end code, hence why I have rated this criterion
at 50\% completion. \\ \vspace{0.1cm}

This issue could be addressed in the future by using security
tools like ZAP which scan your code and look for potential
security vulnerabilities. To ensure safety an external cyber-security
company could be hired to perform a detailed analysis on the system,
from which all of the security vulnerabilities could be dealt with.
}

\newcommand{\evalthree}{%
Though this success criteria point is completely subjective, I do believe that the designs ended up being professional
looking and aesthetically appealing. This claim is reinforced by the results of the survey we conducted. Indeed >89\%
of our surveyees said they like the design fullfilling the criteria stated in success criteria 3. This shows that my
opinion is the majority and many others also find the UI to be professional looking and aesthetically appealing.
\textit{Reference:} {\sffamily Test (16)} \url{https://youtu.be/Ii8QkbziWo4}
}

\newcommand{\evalfour}{%
I have met this success criteria completely by using the 100ms library to allow users to video conference with each
other. As was discussed in the development section I tried a few different methods before landing on 100ms, however
I believe that the solution I have found right now provides the simplest way of implementing video conferencing. The
backend simply makes an HTTP request to the 100ms servers to ask for host and guest codes to a room, once we have
recieved these codes we display a dialog box to the user informing them of the code that they can then share to others.
Other users then simply navigate to the join call page, enter the code and they will have joined the video conference.
This feature is indeed evidenced in iterative test 15 as seen below.
\textit{Reference:} {\sffamily Test (15)} \url{https://youtu.be/mX33jG6B1Ik} \url{https://youtu.be/D2J8Y2TnWjo}
}

\newcommand{\evalfive}{%
I have met this success criteria completely by using the Clerk API to handle our login system. By importing the
Clerk library and retrieving the API key using an environment variable we use Clerk's built-in login and registration
components to provide a modern and technically robust username and password system.
\textit{Reference:} {\sffamily Test (2)} \url{https://youtu.be/IjwQH1Z8aPw}
}

\newcommand{\evalsix}{%
I believe that we have partially met this success criterion. We have used Clerk to manage usernames and passwords
in our application. From our tests in the development section, Clerk seems to only verify whether or not the given
password is 8 or more characters. For some very common passwords Clerk prohibits the user from trying to make an
account and gives the output \texttt{This password has been found as part of a breach and can not be used, please
try another password instead.} However Clerk doesn't give any specific password requirements other than
\texttt{Your password must contain 8 or more characters.} \textit{Reference:} {\sffamily Test (2)}
\url{https://youtu.be/p-rWgn692KU} \\ \vspace{0.1cm}

To solve this issue we have a number of options. On the buisness plan Clerk actually allows us to enforce specific
password requirements (\url{https://clerk.com/blog/a-new-password-experience}), however this will cost us money and
we currently have no way to make any money back. We could also look into and reseach other username and password
management libraries in order to find alternatives, this will ensure that our username and password will still be
robust and secure, through usage of a thoroughly tested and reputable Javascript library. Finally if we have no other
solutions one could resort to implementing the username and password system themselves from scratch, however the
downside with this approach is that it may not be \textit{completely} secure, without comprehensive security testing,
this fact coupled with the truth that implementing such a system will take a good amount of time and resources
justifies it being the last resort option.
}

\newcommand{\evalseven}{%
I believe that we have not met this success criteria. For our video conferencing system we utilise the 100ms video
conferencing library, which means that any latency issues will not be resolvable on our end. In this manner the
latency of our video conferencing applciation is totally dependent on the perfomance of the 100ms servers at that
moment in time. Since we have no control over the performance of the 100ms servers we cannot ever be certain that
our video conferencing latency won't exceed 150ms, because the performance of the 100ms servers will be constantly
changing and varying due to a number of factors outside of our control. The fact that we cannot ever affirmatively
make the claim that our latency is below 150ms coupled with the fact that no real attempt was made to test the
latency of our application, constructs a detailed justification as to why I believe that success criteria 7 was not
met. \\ \vspace{0.1cm}

We now propose an idea to potentially resolve this issue. Since the amount of latency will be constantly varying it
makes sense to conduct tests on the performance of our system at regular intervals (perhaps each hour). To achieve
this we could write a script that accesses the website and starts a video conference with 2 bots and computes a
value for the average latency over a span of some $n$ seconds. Occasionally the 100ms servers will be down for
maintenance or due to an outage. In such a case we could notify our user on the home and landing pages of the status
of the 100ms servers.
