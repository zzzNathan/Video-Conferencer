\subsection*{Explaining and justifying the breakdown}

As discussed in \ref{sec:computational} decomposition can 
reduce the complexity of a system by providing clear sub-tasks
that need to be achieved in order to solve a larger more 
complicated task. Moreover this method of organising tasks 
motivates a more modular approach to the implementation of our
system; each one of the main sub-tasks is neatly and clearly 
visualised and the overall presentation shows how each
sub-task relates to the others. \\ \vspace{0.2cm}

Starting from the top of the diagram I chose to display a
home page once the user initially accesses our website. The 
home page will be primarly used to greet the user, show them 
what the web-app can do and get them to login. However from
the home page users will also be able to access the system 
documentation as well as a help page if users are having issues
with using the system. We justify the need for a homepage by 
highlighting the importance of a first impression. A 
well-designed homepage can capture the attention of the user
and encourage them to explore the rest our web-app. If the
homepage is able to provide a good first impression we will be
able to garner a larger userbase, and simultaneously ensure an 
excellent user experience as they move around the UI. Moreover
if our users are satisfied then our client will be too. 
Documentation for the system will also be freely available to 
find on the the home page to be easily accessible for
developers. Furthermore the inclusion of the documentation 
on the home page means that developers aren't forced to create
an account just to read the documentation, saving much time for
these users. In this manner the system becomes entirely 
\textit{self-contained}, that is no other external resources 
would be necessary in order to use, maintain or update the
system. Finally in the case that users are experiencing issues
with the software a help page will also be clearly available on
the home page in order to answer FAQs as well as guide the user
through any troubleshooting. \\ \vspace{0.2cm}

The next pages require the user to first login. Upon entering 
the login page the user will be asked whether this is their 
first time using our system and if so they will be prompted to 
create an account. If it isn't the user's first time on our 
application then they will enter their username and password
and login to their account. The reason that we ask the user to 
login is because we would like each user to video conference 
with the settings that are most comfortable for them, once the
user logs in we can apply their specific accessibility 
settings that are tied to their account. Therefore in asking
the user to login before they begin video conferencing we are 
encouraging the user to take full advantage of our software by 
allowing them to first, adjust the settings to match their 
needs and requirements. \\ \vspace{0.2cm}

Once the user has logged in they will have complete access to 
the entire functionality of our web-app. I decided to seperate
the main content of the system into 3 pages, 1) Settings page,
2) Create call page, 3) Join call page. I chose to split the 
application into 3 main pages so that users won't have to 
search the app through one long overcrowded page in order to 
find what they are looking for. With this system users will be
able to quickly navigate to the page that they need and find 
what they are looking for easily on that page. Additionally, 
the concept of splitting our content onto multiple pages is 
easily scalable, if the site is updated and more content is 
added the developers can simply add a new page onto the site.
Consequently the system can rapidly expand in order to 
accommodate the growing number of user demands without
requiring a full website re-design each time an update is 
made. \\ \vspace{0.2cm}

The settings page will be where all the configurations and 
options for our system can be set/changed. It will be split
into 3 main tabs; the audio tab, the video tab and the 
accessibility tab. Each tab will hold settings related to it's
name that is, the audio tab will hold settings related volume
and sound and etc. Once a user makes some changes to any of the
settings their changes will be saved to their account and this 
data will remain on the database. The descision to split 
settings into 3 main tabs not only improves the user experience
by allowing users to find the settings they are looking for
easily but it's also in harmony with one of my client's main 
requests for this project; to have a \textit{"focus on 
simplicity"}. The descision to have settings for our system
will help each user to tailor their video conferencing
experience to fit to their personal needs. This allows us to 
create 1 system that is able to accommodate for a large 
number of people enhancing the accessibility of our platform, 
a request outlined by my client in \ref{sec:interview}.

% config id so that configs that are the same use same id

\textit{Explaining and justifying the ER diagram draft.}
This entity relationship (ER) diagram was my first attempt at
designing the database for this project. It captures the 
general structure and idea that I had in mind for how the
database of my system should work. Loosely there are 4 main 
categories of data, login data, audio configurations,
video configurations and accessibility configurations, that
would have to be stored in our database. Naturally I decided 
to split these 4 categories into 4 individual tables, such 
that each table should hold 1 category of data. This should 
make life simpler once I begin implementation, for example 
when I have to make a queries about a collection of related
pieces of data I will only need to query the 1 table whose 
label should cover the data I need at that point. I make use 
of a unique numeric ID in order to identify each user and this
is seen as the primary key in the table {\sffamily Logins}.
These IDs are then used to link each user account to their 
relevant configurations via the 3 tables ending in 
{\sffamily \_cfg}. Though this design choice was ok for a 
first draft I soon realised that there were obvious
improvements that could be made. I present some of the flaws
of our current design with an illustration. Suppose that you 
wish to find \emph{all} the configurations that a specific 
user has tied to their account.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Pseudo code for finding all configurations tied to a
user.}
\label{alg:long}
\sffamily

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \Function{Get\_All\_Configs}{ID}
    \Let{User\_ID}{ID}
    \Let{Configs}{$\{\}$} \Comment{Let Configs be an array.}
    \State{}
    
    \State{Configs.insert( Query\_tbl(Audio\_cfg, User\_ID, Speaker volume) )}
    \State{Configs.insert( Query\_tbl(Audio\_cfg, User\_ID, Mic volume) )}
    \State{Configs.insert( Query\_tbl(Audio\_cfg, User\_ID, Mic on by default) )}
    \State{Configs.insert( Query\_tbl(Audio\_cfg, User\_ID, Hide self-view) )}
    \State{\ldots}
    \State{}

    \State{\textbf{return} Configs}
  \EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\end{algorithm}

\mdseries

Algorithm \ref{alg:long} shows a sketch of the algorithm
necessary to solve our problem in pseudo-code. Unfortunately
with our database approach this request is tedious and
inelegant. The function will call the \code{Query\_tbl()}
function 9 times! Not only will this function be slow, due to
the repeated queries to an external database, but it
also violates the DRY software development principle we are
adhering to, as discussed in \ref{sec:computational}. We now 
propose a solution to this issue that allows us to use at most
2 calls to the \code{Query\_tbl()} function.

\end{tikzpicture}

\caption{The final ER diagram.}
\label{fig:erdf}
\end{figure}

\textit{Explaining and justifying the final ER diagram.}
As a pre-requisite to the discussion of our final ER diagram, 
we will first explain exactly what a JSON string is and why we
chose to use it here. A JavaScript object notation (JSON) 
string is a string of key value pairs similar to a hashmap or 
a dictionary. As we can see in the name the format of the
string is based on JavaScript's syntax. One advantage of this
format is that we can quickly turn it into a JavaScript object
with JavaScript's built-in \code{JSON.parse()} function. JSON
syntax is straightforward and easy for developers to read and
understand;

\begin{minted}[
  linenos, bgcolor=codebg, frame=lines, framesep=15\fboxrule,
  framerule=1pt, rulecolor=\color{gray!40}]{js}
  // 32 is the key code for space, 13 is the key code for enter.
  var Access_data = JSON.parse('{
    "Font size": 18,
    "Macros": {
      "Unmute": 32,
      "Cam off": 13 
    },
    "Closed captioning": false
  }');
\end{minted}

the example above presents how the JSON string in the Access 
data attribute may look. Thanks to the JSON syntax our data 
is clear and easily understood, this enables developers to be
able to look at the data that is being stored in these 
JavaScript objects, so that they can have an easier time 
debugging any unintentional results or errors that may occur 
in our database system. Hence the application of JSON strings 
provides a neat and structured format to store data as well as
improves the maintainability of the database portion of our
system. Moreover the format works very nicely in harmony with
the JavaScript programming language, a language that we will
make use of extensively seeing as our system is a web-app, 
because of the close relationship between JavaScript and JSON
syntax. \\ \vspace{0.2cm}

The changes in the final ER diagram all revolve around the new
ConfigID attribute. The user's complete configuration used to 
be comprised of numerous attributes that were stored across
multiple tables. Now each collection of configuration
attributes has been given it's own table in the
{\sffamily Configs} table. This table stores a string, more 
precisely a JSON string, that maps each configuration
attribute to it's corresponding value. In essence instead of 
treating each configuration attribute as it's own seperate
object, we now store all of a user's configurations together
in one object, like how a bag stores a collection of items. 
This approach to our database design allows us to solve the 
problem we had in \ref{fig:erdd}, now in order to request 
\textit{all} of a user's configurations we may use the 
following two-liner;\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tblr}{colspec={l}, rowsep=0pt}
  {\sffamily Config\_ID} $\gets$ {\sffamily Query\_tbl(Logins, UserID, ConfigID)}\\
  {\sffamily \textbf{return} Query\_tbl(Configs, Config\_ID, Cfg data)}\\
\end{tblr}
\end{center}

Not only is this code much shorter and more clear than the 
code in algorithm \ref{alg:long} but it will also run much
faster, with just 2 calls to \code{Query\_tbl()}. Moreover
with this new approach we can still adhere to the DRY software
development principle, since we are no longer forced to repeat
code unnecessarily. Another issue that this new design solves
is duplicate configurations. For instance in figure 
\ref{fig:erdd} if 2 users happen to have the same
configuration then this data will simply be duplicated in our 
table and take up unnecessary space in our table. However 
with the design in figure \ref{fig:erdf} if 2 users have for
example the same audio settings then they can simply use the
same audio ID, meaning that this specific audio configuration 
only needs to be stored once in our database.

\textit{Justifying the DFD.} The DFD above allows me and my 
client to be able to clearly understand the plans for the 
proposed system, in terms of some of it's main features and 
functionalities. Furthermore the DFD diagram can be compared to
the previous system's DFD diagram to ensure that the new 
system is an adequate replacement, as discussed in
\ref{sec:currdfd}. The usage of primitive shapes and clear 
labelling ensures that the diagram is easily digestible, such 
that even those who don't understand anything about software
architecture will be able to grasp the structure of the 
proposed solution. Consequently these diagrams also work to 
improve the maintainability of the system, even new developers
with minimal programming experience will have an intuitive 
understanding of how the proposed system works and it's
overarching structure. Hence thanks to the creation of these 
diagrams we do not only equip the future maintainers of this 
system with all the necessary understanding that they require
to make changes, but we also promote a design culture of clear
and maintable software. Then if the future maintainers of this
software feel motivated to do the same we can ensure that our 
software will maximise it's longevity, through the constant 
innovation and improvement of our system namely via it's 
future maintainers.
